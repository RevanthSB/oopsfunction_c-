I have created a program of student mark allocation system using object oreinted programming 
program structure includes 
     1.Constructor - parametersized constructor
     2.Mutators
     3.Accessors
     4.Facilitators
  constructor - It will send the arguments at the time of constructing an objects
  Mutators and Accesors are collectively known as property function
          Mutators - Write Only property
